# fairspec-python

Python uv workspace monorepo — a data management framework built on the Fairspec standard
and Polars DataFrames: metadata models, a table engine with per-format plugins, dataset
source plugins, and a CLI. (Also read by Claude Code via `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.)

## Rules

- **Never commit unless asked to**
- **Never add co-authored by Claude Code to commits!**
- **Never push main or pull requests to origin unless asked to**
- **Never amend or rewrite existing commits unless asked** (`git commit --amend`, `git reset` of already-made commits, `git rebase`, force-squash) — other worktrees or sessions may be based on those commits. Fold in changes with a follow-up commit instead.
- Prioritize using LSP capabilities if possible
- When resolving a TODO, follow its instructions literally
- Run type checking, specs and linting as part of your tasks
- Start a plan from a new/updated API summary (models/signatures) and the most challenging points, then continue with your default settings
- Update docs when a change requires it

## Skills

Depth lives in `project/skills/` (reached by Claude Code through the `.claude/skills` symlink), so
this file carries invariants and the skills carry procedure. Reach for one before working in
its area:

| skill            | when                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `review-changes` | reviewing a pull request — also what the review workflow runs |

## Commands

- `uv run task install` — `uv sync --all-packages` plus the lefthook hooks
- `uv run task test` — full gate: lint + type + unit
- `uv run task lint` — `ruff check`
- `uv run task format` — `ruff format`, auto-fix formatting
- `uv run task type` — `ty check`
- `uv run task unit` — pytest with coverage (html + json reports)
- Single test — `uv run pytest metadata/fairspec_metadata/actions/descriptor/_test/load_unit.py`, or `uv run pytest -k "name"`
- `uv run task coverage` — open the generated `htmlcov` report
- `uv run task build` — `uv build --all-packages` into `build/`
- `uv run task publish` — `uv publish build/*`
- `pnpm leaks` / `pnpm vulns` / `pnpm scan` — gitleaks / semgrep / both
- `pnpm deps` — update all dependencies to their latest versions
- `pnpm docs:start` / `pnpm docs:build` — the livemark documentation site

## Modules

Packages form a strict DAG — `metadata` depends on nothing and everything layers up from it.
Never introduce an edge that reverses this.

```
metadata ─► dataset ─► table ─► library ─► terminal ─► fairspec
```

A package may depend on any layer below it, not only the adjacent one — `table` pulls in both
`dataset` and `metadata`, and `library` pulls in all three.

Each workspace directory `<name>/` holds one import package `<name>/fairspec_<name>/`, except
the meta-package, which is `fairspec/fairspec/`, and `project/`, which ships nothing.

- `metadata` — pydantic models (`Resource`, `Dataset`, `TableSchema`, `Column`, `FileDialect`), descriptor load/save, path normalization, JSON Schema profiles. No `fairspec-*` dependencies; the base of the graph.
- `dataset` — file, folder and stream I/O plus dataset-source plugins: ckan, descriptor, folder, github, zenodo, zip.
- `table` — the Polars-backed table engine (normalize/denormalize, column checks and types, schema inference, the dialect sniffer) plus file-format plugins: arrow, csv, inline, json, parquet, sqlite, xlsx.
- `library` — the plugin registry and the facade actions every consumer calls: `load_table`, `save_table`, `load_dataset`, `save_dataset`, `validate_*`, `infer_*`.
- `terminal` — the `fairspec` CLI (typer), one command group per entity.
- `fairspec` — umbrella package re-exporting `fairspec_library` and shipping the CLI binary.
- `project` — the documentation site in `docs/`, the agent skills in `skills/` (reached as `.claude/skills`), and the docs guard in `_test/`. Not a uv workspace member and nothing imports it, which is why the skills live here rather than in a package something imports.

Unlike `fairspec-typescript`, this repo has no `mcp-server` and no `extension` package.

## Code structure

Organise by **concern folder, then entity**: group a file by what it _is_ (an action, a
model, a command), then subgroup by the entity it acts on.

- `actions/<entity>/<verb>.py` — the operations everything else wraps (`actions/table/save.py`, `actions/column/create.py`).
- `models/<entity>.py` — pydantic models and their derived types.
- `plugins/<name>/` — a self-contained plugin: `plugin.py` (the class), `settings.py`, `__init__.py`, and its own `actions/` tree.
- `commands/<entity>/<verb>.py` (terminal) — CLI commands.
- `helpers/<name>.py` — small supporting functions. `utils/<name>/` — heavier self-contained modules (e.g. `table/fairspec_table/utils/sniffer/`).
- `services/`, `profiles/`, `schemas/`, `params/` — external clients, JSON Schema profiles, bundled schemas, CLI option definitions.
- Root files, one concern each: `__init__.py` (the public API surface), `plugin.py`, `settings.py`.

### `_test` and `_shared`

A leading underscore marks a directory that is **not a member of the structure around it**.
TypeScript uses a leading `-` for this; Python cannot, because `_shared` is imported by its
siblings and `-shared` is not a valid identifier.

The same constraint sets the test suffix. TypeScript names tests `<module>.unit.ts`; Python
uses `<module>_unit.py`, not `<module>.unit.py`, because a dot is not legal in a module name
and specs import their subject relatively — `.unit.py` would break every `from ..load import`.

- **`_test/`** — unit tests and everything that exists only to serve them. `<module>.py` is tested by `_test/<module>_unit.py`, fixtures live in `_test/fixtures/`, and generated artifacts (VCR cassettes) in `_test/fixtures/generated/`. A shared test double goes in the same folder, named after its export (`plugins/xlsx/actions/table/_test/test_data.py`).
- **`_shared/`** — _production_ code shared by the siblings around it that must not itself be one of them: a helper among one-action-per-file modules (`actions/table/_shared/helpers.py`). Not fixtures, not mocks. A `_shared/` folder can hold its own `_test/`.

Test discovery is by the `*_unit.py` **filename suffix** (`python_files` in `pyproject.toml`),
not the folder name — the folder is a structural convention. Move a test and its `fixtures/`
together: fixture paths resolve from `os.path.dirname(__file__)`, and the `vcr_cassette_dir`
fixture resolves from the test file's own directory.

**Every directory needs an `__init__.py`**, `_test/` and `_shared/` included. Specs import
their subject relatively (`from ..load import load_descriptor`), and pytest walks up the
`__init__.py` chain to name the module — one missing marker makes the walk stop early and the
relative import reaches beyond the top-level package.

## Formats

- Use 4-space indentation, UTF-8 encoding, and LF line endings
- Ruff is configured at `line-length = 90` with `E501` ignored
- Use PascalCase for classes, snake_case for functions, methods, and variables
- Place high-level public items first in a file and low-level private items last

## Conventions

- uv workspace, Python `>=3.12`, hatchling per member, taskipy for tasks
- Function names are **verb_noun** — a verb plus the noun it acts on (`load_descriptor`, `inspect_json_schema`, `create_column_from_property`), never a bare verb or bare noun
- Files are snake_case, named after the verb **without repeating the folder** — `actions/descriptor/load.py` exports `load_descriptor`, not `load_descriptor.py`
- One export per file is the default, not an absolute: a file may export a closely related pair
- **`__init__.py` barrels are deliberate and required.** Each package's `__init__.py` is a curated list of explicit named re-exports — never `import *` outside the meta-package. Adding a public API means adding its line there.
- Commit style: Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`); python-semantic-release derives the changelog and version bumps from them

## Types

- Use Python type hints; target Python 3.12+
- Type checking is `ty` (`uv run task type`), configured under `[tool.ty.rules]`
- Never use `Any` without permission

## Specs

- Unit tests are pytest, named `*_unit.py`, in collocated `_test` folders
- Use `class TestXxx:` with `def test_...` methods
- Don't add useless comments like "Arrange", "Act", "Assert"
- Network tests use `@pytest.mark.vcr` from pytest-recording; the cassette lands in `_test/fixtures/generated/<TestClass>.<test_name>.yaml`. Renaming a class or test renames that file, so the old cassette is orphaned and the next run silently re-records from the live network — check `git status` after renaming a recorded test.

## Docs

- Add docstrings only for public APIs and don't use them for files
- **Comments must not outnumber code.** If a file has more comment lines than code lines, the comments get cut, not the code. A single comment is at most ~3 lines. The bar is not "true" or "useful context" — it is: **name the specific mistake this comment prevents**. If you cannot name one in a sentence, delete it. Most code needs no comment at all: a file with zero is the normal case, not a gap to fill.
- **Design rationale is git history, not file content.** `git log`/`git blame` already hold why a thing was chosen and what it replaced. A file carries only what someone editing THAT line needs in order not to break something — a non-obvious invariant, a failure that presents as success, a deliberate deviation from a rule in this file.
- Never worth a line: restating what the next statement plainly does · explaining what a well-named function already names · narrating rejected alternatives · defending a choice nobody would question · a preamble on every entry in a config object
